    "## Viral Video Activity\n",
    "\n",
    "Every few weeks it seems that there is a new \"viral\" video (a new TikTock dance, a funny cat video, a clip of someone being pranked, etc.) that everyone has seen. This video of Brody the dog interupting the weather forcast (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XehLZLOyVUc) has been viewed over 3 million times on YouTube since it was posted in April. How do these videos spread? Can we use computers to predict the spread of a viral video? Are we able to estimate how many people will watch a viral video? How long it will be popular for? In this activity we are going to use code to try and answer these questions.   "
